# [CEISMIC Xplore](http://xplore.ceismic.org.nz)

Roads open and close, landmarks come and go, and it's sometimes hard to know where you are.

In an ever-changing landscape, we can lose the connection between the past and the present. Places we used to know are unfamiliar and streets have a whole new feel. Maybe you find yourself standing on a corner, wondering, what used to be here?

For the past six years, CEISMIC has been recording these changes. This game takes a series of images from the archive and asks you to locate them on a map of the Four Avenues. Challenge your friends to test their own knowledge and see how you measure up!

CEISMIC Xplore is about remembering and reconnecting. Xplore our city in a new and fun way!
